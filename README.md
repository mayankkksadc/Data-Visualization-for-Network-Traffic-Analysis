# **Network Traffic Analysis and Visualization**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the code, datasets, and results from the project *Network Traffic Analysis and Visualization*. The primary goal is to analyze network traffic patterns, detect cyber-attacks, and visualize actionable insights using machine learning techniques and real-time simulation tools like Power BI. This project leverages the CICIDS 2017 dataset for anomaly detection and explores the impact of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on model performance and visualization clarity.
